# Eaglercraft1.8.8-Singleplayer-Multiplayer-

(The main file detects new updates from the creator and will ask you to download an updated version if it exists, so I don't have to keep changing the file to the latest version)
(I also may have changed some of the in game video settings so it isn't default settings)

Eaglercraft 1.8.8 javascript runtime. Multiplayer, singleplayer, and LAN worlds available. Customizable profile, skins, capes, and controls. Game modes including creative, survival, peaceful, and more! Villages, mine shafts, dungeons, caves, ravines, many different biomes, and other things can spawn. The Nether and End are also available. Commands are the same as the real Minecraft. 

(I shamelessly ripped this from the eaglercraft 1.5.2 github desc)

Contains pretty much everything actual minecraft 1.8.8 has

# How to launch game in browser:
1. Download the zip file (click that green "code" button in the top right corner and click download zip).

2. Right click the zip in your files and click extract all.

3. Find the eaglercraft1.8.8.html file.

4. Open the file and let it load.

# IMPORTANT!
When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 1–5 MINUTES! It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5–10 minutes. Keep in mind that this is an old version of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avialable.

Disclaimer: I do not own Eaglercraft, and I am not associated with it in any way, this is just a way for people to access it fullscreen on browser.
